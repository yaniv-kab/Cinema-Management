> Movie Management Site With user permissions allocation and restrictions on how long they can use the site
Using the project requires an account to sign-in with, which is only available upon getting an invite to create one. Inside the movie management one can create users with a username but no password, which later needs to be filled-in to create an account. Allows user management; create, update, delete; user permission allocation, and restrictions on how long they can use the site.
